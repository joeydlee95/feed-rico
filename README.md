# Feed Rico
This server application will be able to communicate with the custom-made hardware setup at home to feed my dog (TODO: information and design plans on hardware). 

## Basics
1. You login and authenticate yourself.
2. Choose hardwares that you own.
3. Select actions from the hardware page.

## Actions
* getInfo() - Should contain last fed (time and date), how empty the container is, maybe pictures of eating
